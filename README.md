# TravelScrapbook

*** IN PROGRESS ***

My latest project is an app to log destinations you have visited & a wish list of destinations you would like to visit all visualised using apple maps. Users create an account to save their data.

Key features include:

  - User account creation using Firebase
  - Firebase storage for visited destination thumbnail images
  - Image caching
  - Firestore Listeners for real time updates
  - Mapkit Integration with custom map annotations
  
  ** Still to add:
  - In-app purchases
  - Account deletion
  - Light & dark mode
